### BEM
[BEM] is nice, but some may be irked at its unconventional syntax. RSCSS pretty much follows BEM conventions, only with a different syntax.

```html
<!-- BEM -->
<form class='site-search site-search--full'>
  <input  class='site-search__field' type='text'>
  <button class='site-search__button'></button>
</form>
```

```html
<!-- rscss -->
<form class='site-search -full'>
  <input  class='field' type='text'>
  <button class='button'></button>
</form>
```

## Terminologies

The same concepts exist in similar ways in other CSS structuring ideologies.
