# CSS preprocessors

It's recommended to use RSCSS conventions with a preprocessor. These preprocessors are very mature and highly recommended:

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) (with [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) and [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import))

Other preprocessors such as [Less](http://lesscss.org/) would suffice, too. You may also use RSCSS without a preprocessor.
