## [v2.0.0]
> _Unreleased_

This is the first release of the second edition of RSCSS. There are some changes to recommendations:

* Components are allowed to have margins. This lets you use components together in a page without worrying about their margins.
* `@extend` is no longer recommended. This has caused a lot of debate (#9), and this hasn't really been used much in practice.

## [v1.3.0]
> Jun  3, 2015

Reorganized the document into clearer sections. No content changes.

* Introduction: updated this section to reflect the purpose of rscss better.

## [v1.2.0]
> Jun  3, 2015

* Add helpers.
* Remove 'work in progress' icon — rscss should be considered pretty stable now.

## [v1.1.0]
> Feb 10, 2015

Child selectors are now the preferred convention for styling elements. ([#2])

## v1.0.0
> Jan 30, 2015
