RSCSS
=====

Reasonable System for CSS Stylesheet Structure.<br>
A set of simple ideas to guide your process of building maintainable CSS.

Introduction
------------

Any CSS greater than 1000 lines will get unwieldy. You'll eventually run into these common pitfalls:

* "What does this class mean?"
* "Is this class still being used?"
* "If I make a new class `green`, will there be a clash?"

**rscss** is an attempt to make sense of all these. It is not a framework. It's simply a set of ideas to guide your process of building maintainable CSS for any modern website or application.
